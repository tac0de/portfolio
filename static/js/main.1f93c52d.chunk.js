People can search cafes and restaurants close to their location via the map. They can click markers shown on the map to see detailed information like addresses, contact number, opening days, and menus.","The Unicorn List is a website that you can find most of the unicorn companies that are out there sorted by their valuations. People can view information such as company name, valuations, date joined, country, industry, and selected investors. In Desktop these are represented as tables and card-like layouts in the mobile.","Freestyle Rap Coach is a website made for those who like to rap on the fly.

The problems I had to go through was how to implement Kakao map API smoothly into the site. I put some time on learning about the API and getting familiar with it. I really worked hard in creating json data for individual cafes and restaurants manually. Since I couldn't find a way to scrape these 24 hours places data in a better way, I looked up on both Kakao and Naver map for opening hours, compared in order to verify the info.","The Unicorn List was developed in order to view unicorn companies thoroughly using responsive custom layout. The table HTML were generated using JS through fetching json data that was scraped from other site. It was experimental to implement mobile version of table layout since traditionally, tables used to have horizontal scrollbar when the screen becomes mobile size. I learned intresting, new way of building flexable layout making this website.","Freestyle Rap Coach was built in suggestion of my older brother since he was into rap music. I benchmarked a similar site and tried to design neatly. Functional code was hard because I was not good at web development at that time and dealing with JS timer and if/else statement used to create dropdown selection button came to me as confusion.
